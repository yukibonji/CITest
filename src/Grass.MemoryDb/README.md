# Savanna.MemoryDb

This project contains an in-memory implementation of an IEventStore, IReadModel, etc.

It also contains a set of sample data that can be applied
to get a db that is pre-populated (e.g. for testing)

See the README for Savanna.Core for more information on how this fits in with the other projects.
